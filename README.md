Female supervillain trading card app â€“ REST API version
This app lets users collect digital supervillain trading cards, like baseball cards, but with a villainous twist. Users will be able to add their own villains including names, descriptions, photos, interests and special powers. 
I used Python and Flask. 
The REST API routes data from the database to the front-end using JavaScript. I created REST API routes and endpoints. This included converting data with jsonify, adding a response status and creating an API Directory. 
API Directory indicates the endpoints, description and their HTTP request methods. 
Used a dictionary to organize the directory and the jsonify module to convert the JSON data to a JSON object.
